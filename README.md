# File Manipulation Script

This Bash script provides functionality for basic file manipulation operations, including copying, moving, and deleting files. It can be run interactively, prompting the user to select an operation and providing necessary inputs, or it can be run with command-line arguments to perform specific actions.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode:

To run the script in interactive mode, simply execute it without any arguments:

### Command-line Mode:

To run the script with command-line arguments, use the following format:


```./manipulation.sh OPTION [SOURCE_FILE] [DESTINATION_FILE]```


Replace `OPTION` with one of the following:

- `-c`: Copy file
- `-m`: Move file
- `-d`: Delete file

Replace `SOURCE_FILE` with the path to the source file and `DESTINATION_FILE` with the path to the destination file (if applicable).
